# Firmware for Relayduino ESP32

unfinished proof of concept

## How to start
- clone this repo
- download mos tool (https://mongoose-os.com/docs/mongoose-os/quickstart/setup.md)
- ./compile.sh

## How to flash for the first time (or recovery)
- connect esp32 using usb (be sure you have right usb-serial drivers installed)
- mos flash

Check mongoose os documentation for more info, such as specifying serial port etc...

### OTA flash
When device was previously flashed with this firmware, you should update firmware remotely, no usb required. Set device ip address in env file then call ./ota.sh. If device isn't connected using ethernet, you should connect to RELAYDUINO_MASTER wifi with default password 123456, then device will be at address 192.168.4.1.

## Configuration

### main
    mos config-set masterboard.id=1
    mos config-set masterboard.slaves=ooooiiii   

Masterboard will operate with id 1, slave boards 0-3 are output boards, slave boards 4-7 are input boards. Warning - double check this when you are lost and board seems not work as expected, maybe you misconfigured the board types (my own experience :D)!

### Transports
#### UDP
For communication using udp packets (for example with loxone), configure following attributes

    mos config-set masterboard.transport.udp.listenport=6666              # port where listen to commands
    mos config-set masterboard.transport.udp.sendaddress="192.168.1.55"   # loxone address
    mos config-set masterboard.transport.udp.sendport=5556                # loxone virtual input port

Command syntax for output board is:

    om1 b2 r14 1    - set relay 14 on slave board 2 on masterboard 1 to ON
    om1 b2 r14 0    - set relay 14 on slave board 2 on masterboard 1 to OFF

Input events generated by input boards has similar syntax:

    im1 b5 i1 0     - input 1 on slave board 5 on masterboard 1 is LOW
    im1 b5 i1 1     - input 1 on slave board 5 on masterboard 1 is HIGH

TODO - this may change in the future, maybe masterboards will not be identified by id anymore (if udp broadcasting feature will be removed)


## Debugging

    mos config-set debug.udp_log_addr=THIS_PC_ADDR:7777
    mos config-set debug.level=3
    while true; do nc -ul -p 7777; sleep 1; done

Do not forget to set loglevel to 0 when finished (it has a performance impact)

To manually test udp transport, you should send command from linux desktop by using:

    echo "om1 b1 r2 1" >/dev/udp/MASTERBOARD_IP_ADDRESS/UDP_LISTEN_PORT

For example

    echo "om1 b1 r2 1" >/dev/udp/192.168.1.30/6666

To manually check input board events, you should listen at your PC for input event commands similar as listen for logs:

    mos config-set masterboard.transport.udp.sendaddress="THIS_PC_ADDRESS"
    mos config-set masterboard.transport.udp.sendport=3333
    while true; do nc -ul -p 3333; sleep 1; done
